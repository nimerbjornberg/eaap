# Execution-as-a-Platform (EaaP)

**This is not a product pitch. It's a manifesto.**

Execution-as-a-Platform (EaaP) is a new architectural layer in digital infrastructure â€” built not for humans, but for machines. It enables AI-generated code to be executed securely, deterministically, and automatically, without relying on traditional DevOps pipelines, containers, or orchestration tools.

This repository contains the public manifesto authored by **Nimer BjÃ¶rnberg**, Co-founder of **NorNor**, June 2025.
