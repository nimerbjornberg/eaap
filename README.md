# Execution-as-a-Platform (EaaP)

**From Prompt to Production â€“ Why AI Needs an Execution Layer, and Why It's Called Heim**

AI now generates code faster than any human can read it. But one fundamental question remains unanswered:  
**What happens after the code is written?**

This repository contains the public manifesto authored by **Nimer BjÃ¶rnberg**, Co-founder of **NorNor**, June 2025.

It introduces Execution-as-a-Platform â€” a new architectural layer in digital infrastructure, built not for humans, but for machines.  
It enables AI-generated code to be executed securely, deterministically, and automatically â€” without relying on traditional DevOps pipelines, containers, or orchestration tools.
